# Leaderboard MVP


## architecture

It' divived into three parts, db layer, server, client

### Database

I have used postgressql in docker so that it would be easy to test

To start postgresql,

./bin/docker-up.sh

Once you start it, initialise it 

./bin/setup-db.sh

DB models can be found on https://github.com/gnuman/leaderboardmvp/blob/master/db/bin/setup-db.sh
